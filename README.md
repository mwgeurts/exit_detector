The TomoTherapy&reg; Exit Detector Analysis Tool is a GUI based standalone application written in MATLAB&reg; that parses [TomoTherapy](http://www.accuray.com) patient archives and DICOM RT Exit Dose files and uses the MVCT response collected during a Static Couch DQA procedure to estimate the fluence delivered through each MLC leaf during treatment delivery.  By comparing the measured fluence to an expected fluence (calculated during optimization of the treatment plan), the treatment delivery performance of the TomoTherapy Treatment System can be observed.

In addition, this project includes the submodule `CalcDose()`, which uses the Standalone GPU TomoTherapy Dose Calculator to calculate the effect of fluence errors (measured above) on the optimized dose distribution and dose volume histogram for the patient. The submodule `CalcGamma()` is also included, and performs a 3D [gamma analysis](README.md#gamma-computation-methods) between the reference and DQA dose distributions using global 3%/3mm (or otherwise specified) criteria.

The user interface provides graphic and quantitative analysis of the comparison of the measured and expected fluence delivered, as well as a graphical display of the planned dose, recomputed dose, and 3D gamma.  Finally a graphical and tabular comparison of structure dose volume histograms is included to investigate the clinical impact of the measured differences.  A report function is included to generate a PDF report of the results for documentation in the patient's medical record.

## Installation and Use

To install the TomoTherapy Exit Detector Analysis Tool as a MATLAB App, download and execute the `TomoTherapy Exit Detector Analysis.mlappinstall` file from this directory. If downloading the repository via git, make sure to download all submodules by running  `git clone --recursive https://github.com/mwgeurts/exit_detector`.

Dose calculation can be performed using either a [MATLAB based TAR method](https://github.com/mwgeurts/thomas_tomocalc) or using an Accuray provided standalone calculator (through a research agreement). To choose a calculation method, edit the `CALC_METHOD` line in `config.txt` to either be `MATLAB` or `GPUSADOSE`. If using MATLAB, and the Parallel Computing Toolbox is installed, dose computation can be sped up by including the `MATLAB_POOL` option in `config.txt`. If present, the tool will attempt to start a parallel pool with the specified number of workers. The number of workers should not exceed the number of processor cores on the workstation.

If using the Accuray standalone executable, the TomoTherapy Exit Detector Analysis Tool must be configured to either calculate dose locally or communicate with a TomoTherapy research workstation. By default, the tool will always search locally first (`gpusadose` must be installed in an execution path available to MATLAB). If not found, the tool will attempt to connect to a remote server using the name and access credentials in the `config.txt` file. The user account must have SSH access rights, rights to execute `gpusadose`, and finally read/write acces to the temp directory.  See Accuray Incorporated to see if your research workstation includes this feature.  For additional information, see the [tomo_extract](https://github.com/mwgeurts/tomo_extract) submodule.

For Gamma calculation, if the Parallel Computing Toolbox is enabled, `CalcGamma()` will attempt to compute the three-dimensional computation using a compatible CUDA device.  To test whether the local system has a GPU compatible device installed, run `gpuDevice(1)` in MATLAB.  All GPU calls in this application are executed in a try-catch statement, and automatically revert to an equivalent (albeit longer) CPU based computation if not available or if the available memory is insufficient.

To run this application, run the App or call `ExitDetector` from MATLAB.  Once the application interface loads, select browse under inputs to load the daily QA and static couch QA patient archive inputs.  Once all data is loaded, the application will automatically process and display the results. If dose calculation is enabled, the user will be prompted whether to calculate dose, and if successful, whether to calculate Gamma.

## Compatibility and Requirements

The TomoTherapy Exit Dose Analysis application uses three inputs: MVCT detector data from a TQA Daily QA module delivery, MVCT data from a patient-specific Static Couch DQA delivery, and a patient archive (following plan approval) of the patient for which the Static Couch DQA was run.  Only helical TomoTherapy plans are currently supported.

The MVCT data can be loaded using two different modes.  In DICOM mode, this application reads Transit Dose DICOM RT objects exported from the TomoTherapy version 5.0 treatment system.  In Archive mode, the MVCT data for the TQA Daily QA module can be loaded from a patient archive of the TQA Daily QA patient, while the Static Couch DQA is loaded from the selected XML.  In Archive mode, both TomoTherapy version 4.2 and 5.0 archives have been validated with this application.

For MATLAB, this application has been validated in versions 8.3 through 9.1, Image Processing Toolbox 8.2 through 9.5, and Parallel Computing Toolbox version 6.4 through 6.9 on macOS 10.8 (Mountain Lion) through 10.12 (Sierra).  The Image Processing Toolbox is required for execution.  As discussed above, the Parallel Computing Toolbox is only required if using the Gamma metric plugin with GPU based computation or if parallel workers are used with MATLAB based calculation.

## Troubleshooting

This application records key input parameters and results to a log.txt file using the `Event()` function. The log is the most important route to troubleshooting errors encountered by this software.

## Methods

The following sections describe the high level theory behind the computation of the measured fluence using the exit detector sinogram.  For full details, see the [wiki pages](https://github.com/mwgeurts/exit_detector/wiki).

### Exit Detector Fluence Computation Methods

The TomoTherapy Exit Detector Analysis application is based on the hypothesis that the MVCT detector response *R(leaf)* for a given leaf with an expected fluence *F(leaf)* can be modeled by the following convolution: 

*R = S (F + E) &otimes; LSF(leaf) + Bkgd*

where *E(leaf)* is the delivery error, *Bkdg* is the background signal on the MVCT detector (due to leakage radiation and dark current), *S(leaf)* is the sensitivity of the channel (*(R-Bkgd)/F* in an open field where *F* is known with minimal error), and *LSF(leaf)* is a Line Spread Function representing the scatter from *leaf* onto the MVCT detctor channels.  In practice, the center of each MLC leaf is mapped to an MVCT detector channel, and *LSF* is measured based on the relative signal from the mapped channel to neighboring leaf channels.  

For mathematical simplicity, *LSF* is further assumed to be identical for all leaves, reducing the convolution to simple multiplication of Discrete Fourier Transforms according to the Convolution Theorem, as shown below:

*FT(R - Bkgd) = FT(S(F + E)) &bull; FT(LSF)*

The above equation can be solved for *E* as follows, where *IFT* denotes the inverse Discrete Fourier Transform:

*E = IFT(FT(R - Bkgd) / FT(LSF)) / S - F*

Upon loading the TQA Daily QA MVCT detector response data, the application parses the parameters *Bkgd*, *LSF*, and *S* based on a known delivery plan and expected MVCT detector response (assuming the system is well twinned to the Gold Standard).

Next, the expected fluence *F* is obtained by parsing the patient archive and extracting the percent leaf open times, relative to the projection time, for the Machine Agnostic delivery plan at each projection.  The measured Static Couch DQA exit detector response *R* is then read through DICOM or the patient archive (see above notes regarding compatibility).  Static Couch DQA plans are used as they allow the couch to remain out of the bore during treatment delivery, yielding a measured MVCT detector response that minimizes additional scatter, allowing a simple *LSF* to be accurately applied. 

### Dose Calculation Methods

Following sinogram analysis, the delivery error *E* for each leaf and projection has been estimated.  During this next step, this error is applied to the Fluence delivery plan.  Dose is calculated twice; first with the original Fluence delivery plan, and then with the error applied.  Constraints are set to the modified delivery plan, such that leaf open times are not allowed to exceed 100% (full open) or below zero.  

Dose is computed using the TomoTherapy GPU Standalone Dose Calculator version 5.0 application `gpusadose`, using inputs derived from the Dynamic Jaw TP+1 beam model.

### Gamma Computation Methods

Following dose re-calculation, a Gamma analysis is performed based on the formalism presented by D. A. Low et. al., [A technique for the quantitative evaluation of dose distributions.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9608475), Med Phys. 1998 May; 25(5): 656-61.  In this formalism, the Gamma quality index *&gamma;* is defined as follows for each point in measured dose/response volume *Rm* given the reference dose/response volume *Rc*:

*&gamma; = min{&Gamma;(Rm,Rc}&forall;{Rc}*

where:

*&Gamma; = &radic; (r^2(Rm,Rc)/&Delta;dM^2 + &delta;^2(Rm,Rc)/&Delta;DM^2)*,

*r(Rm,Rc) = | Rc - Rm |*,

*&delta;(Rm,Rc) = Dc(Rc) - Dm(Rm)*,

*Dc(Rc)* and *Dm(Rm)* represent the reference and measured doses at each *Rc* and *Rm*, respectively, and

*&Delta;dM* and *&Delta;DM* represent the absolute and Distance To Agreement Gamma criterion (by default 3%/3mm), respectively.  

The absolute criterion is typically given in percent and can refer to a percent of the maximum dose (commonly called the global method) or a percentage of the voxel *Rm* being evaluated (commonly called the local method).  The application is capable of computing gamma using either approach, and can be set in `ExitDetector_OpeningFcn()` by editing the line `handles.local = 0;` from 0 to 1.  By default, the global method (0) is applied.

The computation applied in the TomoTherapy Exit Detector Analysis Tool is a 3D algorithm, in that the distance to agreement criterion is evaluated in all three dimensions when determining *min{&Gamma;(Rm,Rc}&forall;{Rc}*. To accomplish this, the modified dose volume is shifted along all three dimensions relative to the reference dose using linear 3D interpolation.  For each shift, *&Gamma;(Rm,Rc}* is computed, and the minimum value *&gamma;* is determined.  To improve computation efficiency, the computation space *&forall;{Rc}* is limited to twice the distance to agreement parameter.  Thus, the maximum "real" Gamma index returned by the application is 2.
